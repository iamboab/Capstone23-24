<a>Due to classrooms that continue to use paper copies, teachers need to create copies for each of their students which can lead to 30 copies for 1 assignment in each class. This then also increases when a teacher has to make multiple pages for their students. </a>
<br>
<strong>Why is this a problem you might ask? </strong>
<br>
<a>This is because teachers will need to ask the main office for paper copies whenever their supply has run out.</a><br>
<strong>Why this is a problem?</strong><br>
<a>Since teachers will either have to walk to the main office and ask for more copy paper or email the main office to be notified of the shortage of paper.</a>
<a>There will also be a chance that the main office does not have enough copy paper so the person who has walked all the way to the main office comes back empty handed just to return another day.</a>

    <a>Many small companies have failed to become larger because there may be a lack of trust within the different departments, ones feeling that another department is incapable of preforming its job, or the incompetent management of the departments. - Chron</a>
